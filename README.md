# Drug Target Prediction

This repository explores drug target prediction using machine learning and curated datasets. I aim to provide insights and come up with practical solutions into potential drug-target interactions.

## Its Features
- **Data Gathering**: Scripts and notebooks for collecting and preprocessing drug-target data.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships and distributions within datasets.
- **Model Experiments**: Implementation of machine learning models to predict drug-target interactions.
